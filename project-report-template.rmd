## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

```{r load-wrangle}
# load and wrangle the data here
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

postpartum_depression <- read_csv(here("data", "HIIT-postpartum-depression.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

postpartum_depression[postpartum_depression == "#NULL!"] <- NA
```


### Figure 3
```{r figure-3}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 4
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.

# Tidy table for graph
psychological_wellbeing <- postpartum_depression %>% 
  select(intervention_group, pre_fs_scale, post_fs_score, postnatal_florishing_scale_score) %>% 
  mutate(
    pre_fs_scale = as.numeric(pre_fs_scale),
    post_fs_score = as.numeric(post_fs_score),
    postnatal_florishing_scale_score = as.numeric(postnatal_florishing_scale_score)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(pre_fs_scale, post_fs_score, postnatal_florishing_scale_score),
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "fs_score"
  )
  
```


### Figure 5
```{r figure-5}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 5. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 5 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


## Task 2: FAIR data principles

## Task 3: Reproducibility brief
