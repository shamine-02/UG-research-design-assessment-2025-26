## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

```{r load-wrangle}
# load and wrangle the data here
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

postpartum_depression <- read.csv(here("data", "HIIT-postpartum-depression.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() 
 
  postpartum_depression[postpartum_depression == "#NULL!"] <- NA


```


### Figure 3
```{r figure-3}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 4
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 5
```{r figure-5}
figure_5_data <- postpartum_depression %>% 
  select(intervention_group, pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale, post_sf12_pcs, postnatal_sf_12_pcs) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  group_by(intervention_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_pre = mean(pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale),
            mean_post = mean(as.numeric(post_sf12_pcs)),
            mean_postnatal = mean(as.numeric(post_sf12_pcs)),
            sd_pre = sd(pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale),
            sd_post = sd(post_sf12_pcs),
            sd_postnatal = sd(post_sf12_pcs)) %>%

               values_to = "value") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = statistic,
              values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(timepoint = factor(timepoint, levels = c("pre", "post", "postnatal"))) %>% 
  mutate(intervention_group = factor(intervention_group))
