## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

```{r load-wrangle}
# load and wrangle the data here
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

postpartum_depression <- read.csv(here("data", "HIIT-postpartum-depression.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() 
 
  postpartum_depression[postpartum_depression == "#NULL!"] <- NA


```


### Figure 3
```{r figure-3}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 4
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 5
```{r figure-5}
figure_5_data <- postpartum_depression %>% 
  select(intervention_group, pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale, post_sf12_pcs, postnatal_sf_12_pcs) %>%
  filter(!is.na(pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale) & (!is.na(post_sf12_pcs) | !is.na(postnatal_sf_12_pcs))) %>%
