## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

```{r load-wrangle}
# load and wrangle the data here
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

postpartum_depression <- read_csv(here("data", "HIIT-postpartum-depression.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()

postpartum_depression[postpartum_depression == "#NULL!"] <- NA
```


### Figure 3
```{r figure-3}

# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.

fig3_postpartum_depression <- postpartum_depression %>% 
  select(starts_with("Edin")|starts_with("Int")) %>% 
  rename("epdss" = edinburg_postnatal_depression_scale_score) %>% 
  drop_na()
  
  
levels <- fig3_postpartum_depression %>% 
  mutate(depression_level = case_when(epdss <10 ~ "norm",
                                      epdss <= 11 ~ "slightly_increased",
                                      epdss > 11 ~ "increased")) %>% 
  group_by(depression_level, intervention_group) %>% 
  count(depression_level) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = depression_level, values_from = n) %>% 
  mutate(totals = rowSums(across(c("increased" : "slightly_increased"))))



#finding percentages
percents <- levels %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(across(c(increased:slightly_increased), 
                ~ .x/totals*100, 
                .names = "percent_{.col}"))


```


### Figure 4
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 5
```{r figure-5}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 5. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 5 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


## Task 2: FAIR data principles

## Task 3: Reproducibility brief
